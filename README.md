Statistics and predictions about covid-19

## Data
The data will be updated everyday from the website: 
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases
This website provides CSV files that are stores in the folder "dataSource". Data on some countries cases can be easily accessed in the following way:

from dataClass import data
pt=data.portugal #contains the number of cases along the days in Portugal

The data accesses will be changed to become simpler and more intuitive.
